beforeHorribleman,Carol ran towards him in no time.\n“YOU CAN'T EAT THE ANGEL TOPPER” she said.\n“THATS WORSE THAN ANY CRIME”,,1,
afterHorribleman,“Dont you know about christmas at all?”\nAnd the nasty man shrugged no\nHe didn't know truly\nHe wasn't some holiday thief \nThe man was just a christmas newbie,30,,
afterHorribleman,So she dragged him back to the church\n“ILL SHOW YOU HOW CHRISTMAS GOES”\nAnd they stealthily returned all that was stolen\nOnce again under everyone's nose.,31,,
afterHorribleman,They walked in like they belonged\nEven had had timeTo sing with the choir,33,,
