beforeHorribleman,"And it led into a dark cave\nThis was it, shed get back those gifts\nShe went in and tried to be brave. ",29,1,
afterHorribleman,Carol had found the Goods!\nShe was so happy she could sing a song\nThat's until she saw the man licking a sled\nShe shouted “YOURE DOING CHRISTMAS WRONG!”,30,,
afterHorribleman,Carol ran towards him in no time.\n“YOU CAN'T EAT THE ANGEL TOPPER” she said.\n“THATS WORSE THAN ANY CRIME”,,,
afterHorribleman,“Dont you know about christmas at all?”\nAnd the nasty man shrugged no\nHe didn't know truly\nHe wasn't some holiday thief \nThe man was just a christmas newbie,30,,
afterHorribleman,So she dragged him back to the church\n“ILL SHOW YOU HOW CHRISTMAS GOES”\nAnd they stealthily returned all that was stolen\nOnce again under everyone's nose.,31,,
afterHorribleman,They walked in like they belonged\nEven had had timeTo sing with the choir,33,,
afterHorribleman,And when carol couldn't reach to put back the angel topper\nThe Not so nasty man was to lift her higher,32,,
afterHorribleman,And so that was their christmas\nAn awkward start but great end\nBut that's a tale as old as time.\nMerry Christmas! \nThanks for playing\nUntil we meet again. ,34,1,
