0start_2_story,,,And as she looked around…
0start_3_story,,,She was shocked to have found.
0start_4_story,,,"At the back of the church, there he stood.\nAnd Carol could tell he was up to no good\nHe had dark fur and horns\nAnd teeth as sharp as thorns "

afterSnowman_26_story,,,Carol said it's impolite to pick your nose in front of a girl

2start_28_story,,,Carol turned and rang the bell once more
2start_29_story,,,"And it led into a dark cave\nThis was it, shed get back those gifts\nShe went in and tried to be brave. "
beforeHorribleman_30_story,,,Carol had found the Goods!\nShe was so happy she could sing a song\nThat's until she saw the man licking a sled\nShe shouted “YOURE DOING CHRISTMAS WRONG!”
beforeHorribleman_31_story,,,Carol ran towards him in no time.\n“YOU CAN'T EAT THE ANGEL TOPPER” she said.\n“THATS WORSE THAN ANY CRIME”
afterHorribleman_32_story,,,“Dont you know about christmas at all?”\nAnd the nasty man shrugged no\nHe didn't know truly\nHe wasn't some holiday thief \nThe man was just a christmas newbie
afterHorribleman_33_story,,,So she dragged him back to the church\n“ILL SHOW YOU HOW CHRISTMAS GOES”\nAnd they stealthily returned all that was stolen\nOnce again under everyone's nose.
