0start_0_story,3.74E+14,那是圣诞前夜，所有人都坐在长椅上\n人们等待唱诗班的歌唱\n在他们中间是卡罗尔\n穿着她的唱诗班服装\n还有一条鲜红色的围巾,"It was the night before Christmas, and all were in their pews\nFolks waited for the choir to sing a song or two\nAnd among them was Carol\nIn her choir apparel \nAnd a scarf of a bright red hue"
0start_1_story,3.74E+14,卡罗尔对其他人感到非常无聊\n所以她的眼睛和思绪开始游荡。,Carol was very bored by those beyond her\nSo her eyes and mind began to wander.

0start_3_story,3.74E+14,她震惊地发现了,She was shocked to have found.
0start_4_story,3.74E+14,在教堂的后面，他站在那里\n卡罗尔可以看出他不怀好意\n他有黑色的毛皮和角\n还有像荆棘一样锋利的牙齿,"At the back of the church, there he stood\nAnd Carol could tell he was up to no good\nHe had dark fur and horns\nAnd teeth as sharp as thorns "
0start_5_story,3.74E+14,他正在做没有人应该做的事,And he was doing what no person should

0start_8_story,3.74E+14,他正在偷窃圣诞节,He was stealing christmas
0start_9_story,3.74E+14,他多么没有创意,How unoriginal could he be
0start_10_story,3.74E+14,最糟糕的是\n这一切就发生在他们的眼皮底下\n他怎么能拿走一切，却没有人注意到,"And the worst part\nIt was happening right under their noses\nHow could he take everything, and nobody notice"
0start_11_story,3.74E+14,当然，除了卡罗尔没有人看到\n她看到了这一切\n她必须阻止这个可恶的人\n只有她有这个胆量。,"Nobody except Carol, of course\nShe saw it all\nShe had to stop this nasty man\nOnly she had the gawl."
0start_12_story,3.74E+14,所以那个可恶的人跑了\n卡罗尔制定了一个计划,So the nasty man ran\nAnd Carol made a plan

afterNun_16_story,3.74E+14,卡罗尔已经摆脱了凯伦修女\n大概……,Carol had lost Sister Karen \nas far as she could tell
afterNun_17_story,3.74E+14,就在这时她注意到地板上的什么东西,That's when she noticed something on the floor
1start_18_story,3.74E+14,其中一个被偷的金色铃铛,One of the stolen golden bells
1start_19_story,3.74E+14,在她敲响它之后\n它揭示了一条穿过教堂门的路,It revealed a path through the church door\nAfter she gave it a ring
1start_20_story,3.74E+14,这条路射入并弯曲进入黑暗的树林\n所以卡罗尔尽可能勇敢地走了过去\n只希望那里没有潜伏什么东西。,The path shot and curved into the dark woods\nSo Carol followed as brave as she could\nJust hope there's nothing lurking.
beforeSnowman_21_story,3.74E+14,卡罗尔被一个雪人逼到了角落,Carol was cornered by a snow man
beforeSnowman_22_story,3.74E+14,她无处可去,There was nowhere for her to go

afterSnowman_27_story,3.74E+14,雪人感到尴尬然后走开了,And the snowman got embarrassed before he walked out
2start_28_story,3.74E+14,卡罗尔转身再次敲响了铃铛,Carol turned and rang the bell once more
2start_29_story,3.74E+14,它通向一个黑暗的洞穴\n就是这样，她会拿回那些礼物\n她走进去，试图勇敢起来。,"And it led into a dark cave\nThis was it, shed get back those gifts\nShe went in and tried to be brave. "
beforeHorribleman_30_story,3.74E+14,卡罗尔找到了货物！\n她高兴得想放声歌唱。\n直到她看见那个男人在舔他的战利品，\n她大喊道：“你的圣诞节过错啦！”,"Carol had found the Goods!\nShe was so happy she could sing a song\nThat's until she saw the man licking a sled\nShe shouted ""YOURE DOING CHRISTMAS WRONG!"""
beforeHorribleman_31_story,3.74E+14,卡罗尔立刻冲向他。\n“你不能吃那个天使头饰！”她说道。\n“这比任何罪行都严重！”,"Carol ran towards him in no time.\n""YOU CAN'T EAT THE ANGEL TOPPER"" she said.\n""THATS WORSE THAN ANY CRIME"""
afterHorribleman_32_story,3.74E+14,“你难道对圣诞节一无所知吗？”\n那个邋遢的男人耸了耸肩表示否定。\n他确实不知道，\n他并不是什么节日大盗，\n只是个圣诞新手。,"""Dont you know about christmas at all?""\nAnd the nasty man shrugged no\nHe didn't know truly\nHe wasn't some holiday thief \nThe man was just a christmas newbie"
afterHorribleman_33_story,3.74E+14,于是她把他拽回了教堂：\n“我要让你看看圣诞节该怎么过！”\n他们蹑手蹑脚地归还了所有赃物，\n再次瞒过了所有人的眼睛。,"So she dragged him back to the church\n""ILL SHOW YOU HOW CHRISTMAS GOES""\nAnd they stealthily returned all that was stolen\nOnce again under everyone's nose."
afterHorribleman_34_story,3.74E+14,他们大摇大摆地走入了人群，\n甚至还有时间加入唱诗班一起歌唱。,They walked in like they belonged\nEven had had timeTo sing with the choir
afterHorribleman_35_story,3.74E+14,当卡罗尔够不到那个天使头饰时，\n那个（不那么）邋遢的男人将她高高举起。,And when carol couldn't reach to put back the angel topper\nThe Not so nasty man was to lift her higher
afterHorribleman_36_story,3.74E+14,这就是他们的圣诞节：\n尴尬的开始，完美的结局。\n这是一个古老而永恒的故事。\n圣诞快乐！\n感谢游玩，\n期待与你再次相遇。,And so that was their christmas\nAn awkward start but great end\nBut that's a tale as old as time.\nMerry Christmas! \nThanks for playing\nUntil we meet again.
